#### Powershell Scripts that I've found useful as an Electrical Engineer and SysAdmin

- [Weather Updates](https://github.com/electronicwarfare/PowershellProjects/blob/main/README.md#weatherupdates)
- [OSIsoft PI - Retrieve Digital Tag Data](https://github.com/electronicwarfare/PowershellProjects/blob/main/README.md#osisoft-pi---retrieve-digital-tag-data)
- [OSIsoft PI - Retrieve Analog Tag Data](https://github.com/electronicwarfare/PowershellProjects/blob/main/README.md#osisoft-pi---retrieve-analog-tag-data)
- [OSIsoft PI - Merge Archives](https://github.com/electronicwarfare/PowershellProjects/blob/main/README.md#osisoft-pi---merge-archives)

### WeatherUpdates
#### This Powershell script retrieves forecasted weather data from the weather.gov based upon a lat long. 
#### The data is then saved in a folder/filename based up on the sitename and date.

### OSIsoft PI - Retrieve Digital Tag Data
#### The archive server, tag name, start and end dates, and output folder are entered.
#### The tag data is then downloaded to a txt file with all of the data for the specified dates.

### OSIsoft PI - Retrieve Analog Tag Data
#### The archive server, tag name, start and end dates, and output folder are entered.
#### The tag data is then downloaded to a txt file with all of the data for the specified dates.

### OSIsoft PI - Merge Archives
#### Sometimes you may need to merge archive files between two different archive servers.
#### This script takes the bin file and the source archive files and automatically merges them to the destination archive files.
#### This process can take a while. 6 months of archives can take 1-2 days depending upon the system processing power.

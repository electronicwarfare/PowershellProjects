# Powershell Projects
#### Powershell Scripts that I've found useful as an Electrical Engineer and SysAdmin

### WeatherUpdates
#### This Powershell script retrieves forecasted weather data from the weather.gov based upon a lat long. 
#### The data is then saved in a folder/filename based up on the sitename and date.

# Powershell Projects
#### Powershell Scripts that I've found useful as an Electrical Engineer and SysAdmin

- [Weather Updates](https://github.com/electronicwarfare/PowershellProjects/blob/main/README.md#weatherupdates)
- [OSIsoft PI - Retrieve Digital Tag Data](https://github.com/electronicwarfare/PowershellProjects/blob/main/README.md#osisoft-pi---retrieve-digital-tag-data)


### WeatherUpdates
#### This Powershell script retrieves forecasted weather data from the weather.gov based upon a lat long. 
#### The data is then saved in a folder/filename based up on the sitename and date.

### OSIsoft PI - Retrieve Digital Tag Data
#### The archive server, tag name, start and end dates, and output folder are entered.
#### The tag data is then downloaded to a txt file with all of the data for the specified dates.
